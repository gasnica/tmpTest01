This is sample C++ code from a project that converts mouse drawn lines into an arc-spline that balances minimum number of segments agains the aesthetic quality of the result.

The key internal code is not included in this sample. The sample compiles & runs, although you won't see the resulting arc-splines. 

Below is an sample image of the full application.
